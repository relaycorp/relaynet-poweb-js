# PoWeb JavaScript Client

Client-side JavaScript library for the [PoWeb binding](https://specs.awala.network/RS-016). This library will be used by:

- Desktop apps (to communicate with their local, private gateway). However, most app developers will want to use a higher-level library (yet to be built as of this writing).
- A desktop gateway like [the one by Relaycorp](https://github.com/relaycorp/relaynet-gateway-desktop) (to communicate with its public gateway over the Internet).
